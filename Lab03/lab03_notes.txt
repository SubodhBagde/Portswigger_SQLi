1 , 2
3 , 4

SQLi Attack (Method #1):

SELECT ? FROM table1 UNION SELECT NULL
-error -> incorrect number of columns

-iteratively increase the NULL until we get correct number of columns.

SELECT ? FROM table1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
-200 response code -> correct number of columns

SQLi Attack (Method #2):

SELECT a, b FROM table1 ORDER BY 3
